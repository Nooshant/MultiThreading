Explanation:

- Thread A calls instanceMethod1(), obtains the lock assigned to the lock1-referenced object, and enters its outer critical section 
   (but has not yet acquired the lock assigned to the lock2-referenced object).
- Thread B calls instanceMethod2(), obtains the lock assigned to the lock2-referenced object, and enters its outer critical section 
   (but has not yet acquired the lock assigned to the lock1-referenced object).
- Thread A attempts to acquire the lock associated with lock2. The JVM forces the thread to wait outside of the inner critical section because thread B holds that lock.
- Thread B attempts to acquire the lock associated with lock1. The JVM forces the thread to wait outside of the inner critical section because thread A holds that lock.
- Neither thread can proceed because the other thread holds the needed lock. You have a deadlock situation and the program 
  (at least in the context of the two threads) freezes up.
  
  
  Caution  Use volatile only where visibility is an issue. Also, you can only use this reserved word in the context of field declarations
  (you’ll receive an error if you try to make a local variable volatile). Finally, you can declare double and long fields volatile, 
  but should avoid doing so on 32-bit JVMs because it takes two operations to access a double or long variable’s value, and mutual exclusion
  (via synchronized) is required to access their values safely.


- You will often use final to help ensure thread safety in the context of an immutable (unchangeable) class.

import java.util.Set;
import java.util.TreeSet;

public final class Planets
{
   private final Set<String> planets = new TreeSet<>();

   public Planets()
   {
      planets.add("Mercury");
      planets.add("Venus");
      planets.add("Earth");
      planets.add("Mars");
      planets.add("Jupiter");
      planets.add("Saturn");
      planets.add("Uranus");
      planets.add("Neptune");
   }

   public boolean isPlanet(String planetName)
   {
      return planets.contains(planetName);
   }
}
```

    -  Immutable objects must not allow state to be modified.
    - All fields must be declared final.
    - Objects must be properly constructed so that “this” references don’t escape from constructors.

# The Producer-Consumer Relationship Version 1

public class PC
{
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
      Shared s = new Shared();
      new Producer(s).start();
      new Consumer(s).start();
   }
}

class Shared
{
   private char c;
   private volatile boolean writeable = true;

   synchronized void setSharedChar(char c)
   {
      while (!writeable)
         try
         {
            wait();
         }
         catch (InterruptedException ie)
         {
         }
      this.c = c;
      writeable = false;
      notify();
   }

   synchronized char getSharedChar()
   {
      while (writeable)
         try
         {
            wait();
         }
         catch (InterruptedException ie)
         {
         }
      writeable = true;
      notify();
      return c;
   }
}

class Producer extends Thread
{
   private final Shared s;

   Producer(Shared s)
   {
      this.s = s;
   }

   @Override
   public void run()
   {
      for (char ch = 'A'; ch <= 'Z'; ch++)
      {
        synchronized(s)
         {
            s.setSharedChar(ch);
            System.out.println(ch + " produced by producer.");
         }
      }
   }
}
class Consumer extends Thread
{
   private final Shared s;

   Consumer(Shared s)
   {
      this.s = s;
   }

   @Override
   public void run()
   {
      char ch;
      do
      {
         synchronized(s)
         {
            ch = s.getSharedChar();
            System.out.println(ch + " consumed by consumer.");
         }
      }
      while (ch != 'Z');
   }
}
```

Explanation:

- The consumer executes s.getSharedChar() to retrieve a letter.
- Inside of that synchronized method, the consumer calls wait() because writeable contains true. The consumer now waits until it
   receives notification from the producer.
- The producer eventually executes s.setSharedChar(ch);.
- When the producer enters that synchronized method (which is possible because the consumer released the lock inside of the wait()
   method prior to waiting), the producer discovers writeable’s value to be true and doesn’t call wait().
- The producer saves the character, sets writeable to false (which will cause the producer to wait on the next setSharedChar() call
  when the consumer has not consumed the character by that time), and calls notify() to awaken the consumer (assuming the consumer is waiting).
- The producer exits setSharedChar(char c).
- The consumer wakes up (and reacquires the lock), sets writeable to true (which will cause the consumer to wait on the next getSharedChar() call when
 the producer has not produced a character by that time), notifies the producer to awaken that thread (assuming the producer is waiting), and returns the shared character.
